# removeDependencies
This repository provides examples and best practices on how to remove dependencies from your codebase in order to write effective unit tests.

The seams are taken from the book "Working Effectively with Legacy Code" by Michael Feathers.

There is also a powerpoint presentation available at ResolveDependencies.pptx

And a decision tree: [Feathers Decision Tree - Dependency Removal]
